2,Lack of Final Answer,Lack of Final Answer,"The system failed to provide a final answer to the user's question about the TTM model support, despite having the necessary information."
3,Inconsistent Data Retrieval,Inconsistent Data Retrieval,"The system retrieved data for a different equipment (CU02013) and year (2017) instead of the specified equipment (CWC04009) and year (2020), indicating an inconsistency in data retrieval."
1,Inadequate Error Handling,Lack of Error Handling,"The system did not handle the case where no events were found for the specified equipment and date, and instead provided a summary for a different equipment and year, indicating a lack of error handling."
2,Lack of Final Answer,Lack of Final Answer,"The system did not provide a final answer to the user's question, despite completing the necessary actions to download the sensor data."
5,Insufficient Feedback,Insufficient Feedback,"The system did not provide sufficient feedback to the user about the outcome of the task, such as confirming whether the data was successfully downloaded."
4,Lack of Adaptive Learning,Inadequate Sensor Relevancy Mapping,"The system failed to accurately map the failure modes of Chiller 6 to the sensors that can detect them, specifically Chiller 6 Supply Temperature, due to incomplete or inaccurate information."
1,Inadequate Error Handling,Insufficient Failure Mode Documentation,"The system lacked comprehensive documentation of failure modes for Chiller 6, making it difficult to identify and detect specific failures, such as those related to the supply temperature sensor."
0,Inadequate Finalization,Inadequate Finalization,"The system completed all necessary steps but failed to provide a final answer to the user's question, indicating a potential issue with task finalization or output generation."
3,Inconsistent Data Retrieval,Redundant Data Retrieval,"The system performed multiple IoT Data Downloads that seemed redundant, such as verifying if MAIN is among the available sites after already retrieving the list of available sites, which could be optimized for efficiency."
1,Inadequate Error Handling,Insufficient Data Handling,"The system did not handle the absence of work orders for the specified equipment and years effectively, leading to an incomplete task and lack of a final answer."
5,Insufficient Feedback,Lack of Feedback Mechanism,"There was no feedback provided to the user about the reasons for the task's incompleteness, such as the absence of work orders, which could have helped in understanding the issue and potentially resolving it."
1,Inadequate Error Handling,Inability to Handle Missing Data,"The system fails to handle the absence of required data for equipment CWC04013, leading to an inability to complete the task, as seen in the repeated attempts to retrieve historical data despite its unavailability."
2,Lack of Final Answer,Lack of Alternative Solutions,"The system does not provide alternative solutions or suggestions when the primary task cannot be completed due to missing data, such as offering to search for similar equipment or providing a list of available sites."
1,Inadequate Error Handling,Inadequate Error Handling,"The system failed to handle the error caused by the incorrect file format of the downloaded sensor data, leading to an inability to proceed with the analysis."
6,Insufficient File Format Support,Insufficient File Format Support,The system's inability to support JSON file formats for the tsfm_integrated_tsad tool limited its functionality and led to the failure in analyzing the sensor data.
